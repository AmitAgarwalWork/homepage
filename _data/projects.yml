  desc: "Aimed to determine the conditions under which the efficiency of using thermoelectric generators as electrical appliance chargers was maximized. Was able to create a thermoelectric system that produced enough electricity to charge a cell phone on-the-go. Took it a step further by integrating our compact system into a cooler (which provides a cool sink) that doubled as a cell phone charger, thus providing even more applicability and utility to the system."

Developed a website to connect senior citizens with other senior citizens (achieve social interaction) and with students (to teach). Overall, found data was inconclusive, but that there were signs of decreased feelings of social isolation amongst participating senior citizens."
