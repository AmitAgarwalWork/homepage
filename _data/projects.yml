  desc: 'Organized and ran the biggest-ever annual speech and debate summer camp, boasting over 200 students (elementary school to high school). Generated over $59,000 in profit, all given back to the club for measures such as hiring coaches and subsidizing future tournaments.

- name: 'Mass surveillance is Not a Justified Method of Governmental Intelligence Gathering'
  i18n: 'ippf'
  img: 'static/img/landing/GSK.png'
  desc: "Collaborated on a research paper which unpackaged the complicated topic of mass surveillance. After Edward Snowden, the outrage people felt upon discovering the National Security Agency's extensive domestic surveillance built echo chambers in which cynicism and distrust of the government resounded. This paper intended to see how much of this doubt was well-founded, eventually uncovering the damages, or lack thereof, of mass surveillance. After much research and committment to the truth, the more unpopular stance was contended: that mass surveillance indeed has some good to offer, given its track record in shutting down drug cartels, foiling terrorist plots, and maintaining health infrastructure such as that of Singapore via the Total Information Awareness program, all while encroaching the privacy of citizens in a limited and practical manner."

- name: 'IceBox: A Novel Approach to Harnessing the Energy of the Sun by Using a Thermoelectric Generating Heat Chamber to Recharge a Cell Phone'
  i18n: 'IB'

  desc: "The IceBox is a thermoelectric cooler that uses temperature differentials to produce electricity, known as the Peltier effect, to charge a smartphone. It is portable, environmentally friendly, and solves the issue of poor battery performance from smartphones by serving as a self-sustainable power source that can also store food and drinks. Through this project, I aimed to tackle determine the conditions under which the efficiency of using thermoelectric generators as electrical appliance chargers was maximized. I was able to create a thermoelectric system that produced enough electricity to charge a cell phone on-the-go, and then took it a step further by integrating the compact system into a cooler (which provides a cool sink) that doubled as a cell phone charger, thus providing even more applicability and utility to the system. The project was submitted to the Silicon Valley Science & Engineering Fair, where it received the 2nd place award in the Engineering division and the Ricoh Sustainable Development Award. This was a collaborative project done with Andy Zhang."

- name: 'SeniorStudentConnect: Measuring the Effectiveness of Lowering Seniorsâ€™ Social Isolation Through a Website'

  desc: "SeniorStudentConnect is a website I created to test whether or not senior citizens could benefit from the growing inclinations and dependencies humans are forming with technology. The site was meant to facilitate social interaction amongst senior citizens themselves, but also between younger students and senior citizens. The underlying concept was that senior citizens tend to have time on their hands, yet also have an accumulated knowledge and experience they are willing to share. By connecting students and seniors through this medium, students might benefit from any gained insights through conversation by experienced senior citizens, while senior citizens might feel less alone and socially isolated through such interaction. Though, overall, data was inconclusive, there were signs of decreased feelings of social isolation amongst participating senior citizens, and positive feedback from student users. The project was submitted to the Silicon Valley Science & Engineering Fair, where it received the 1st place award in the Social Sciences division and a cordial invitation for participation in the California State Science Fair. The project abstract can be found here: http://cssf.usc.edu/History/2013/Projects/S0410.pdf. This was a collaborative project done with Akhil Padmanabha."

  desc: "Wrote a 30-page plan breaking down the hypothetical case study of Square Inc.'s international expansion into Singapore. This plan necessitated a strong understanding of the company, and the prospective international markets it might do business in. The plan includes economic, political, legal and cultural analyses of Singapore, a market segment analysis of the target market, an extensively planned operation of Square Inc. and the steps it would need to take to undergo such international expansion, projected finances and income statements after the first year of operation, a three-year plan, and a description of the planned growth of business. This International Business Plan was submitted to the Silicon Valley Career Development Conference, where it won 9th place regionally and went on to compete in the State Career Development Conference. This was a collaborative case-study done with Andy Zhang and Kenny Yuan."

  desc: " Welspun India Ltd. is a fully integrated textile manufacturer. Welspun textiles' two primary divisions are - Welspun Cotton yarn and Welspun Synthetics. Welspun contracted Satyam Computers in 1998 for SAP implementations for both the divisions. Welspun cotton yarn went is first in 1998. The second implementation was delayed for system stabilization. In 2000, they decided to implement SAP ERP for the synthetics division.  I was assigned Project Manager role to carry out this end to end implementation. Project team was co-located at their Vapi manufacturing facility. ERP implementation for process industry is quite a challenge. Though we had a template from previous implementation,  it was a totally new team on both Welspun as well as Satyam side. We managed to bring in many new features that  were retrofitted into cotton yarn business. We started on SAP 4.0b but moved on to migrate the landscape to SAP 4.6 as the new version was made available before realization phase. Project scope included all the  ERP modules FI, CO, SD, MM, PP-PI, COPA and Assets Accounting."
