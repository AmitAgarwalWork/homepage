  desc: "The IceBox is a thermoelectric cooler that uses temperature differentials to produce electricity, known as the Peltier effect, to charge a smartphone. It is portable, environmentally friendly, and solves the issue of poor battery performance from smartphones by serving as a self-sustainable power source that can also store food and drinks. Through this project, I aimed to tackle determine the conditions under which the efficiency of using thermoelectric generators as electrical appliance chargers was maximized. I was able to create a thermoelectric system that produced enough electricity to charge a cell phone on-the-go, and then took it a step further by integrating the compact system into a cooler (which provides a cool sink) that doubled as a cell phone charger, thus providing even more applicability and utility to the system. The project was submitted to the Silicon Valley Science & Engineering Fair, where it received the 2nd place award and the Ricoh Sustainable Development Award"

- name: 'SeniorStudentConnect: Measuring the Effectiveness of Lowering Seniorsâ€™ Social Isolation Through a Website'

  desc: "SeniorStudentConnect is a website I created to test whether or not senior citizens could benefit from the growing inclinations and dependencies humans are forming with technology. The site was meant to facilitate social interaction amongst senior citizens themselves, but also between younger students and senior citizens. The underlying concept was that senior citizens tend to have time on their hands, yet also have an accumulated knowledge and experience they are willing to share. By connecting students and seniors through this medium, students might benefit from any gained insights through conversation by experienced senior citizens, while senior citizens might feel less alone and socially isolated through such interaction. Though, overall, data was inconclusive, there were signs of decreased feelings of social isolation amongst participating senior citizens, and positive feedback from student users."

  desc: "Department of Natural Resources, State of Washington manages the sate trust land, waterbodies. DNR now oversees five million acres of forest , aquatic bodies, agricultural and commercial land for more than 200 million in annual financial benefits for public schools, state institutions and county services. In late 2004 , DNR contracted Deloitte to implement SAP to manage land and water assets from both rent-outs and financial reporting. They also wanted to manage the financials such that every asset is mapped to a specific set of beneficiaries. Deloitte suggested to implement SAP Flexible Real Estate Management for around 70 % fit of the requirements. Spillover requirements were implemented thru regular ERP implementation ( SD, MM). My role on this project was Assets Team Lead.  The key challenge was to format the huge volume of assets into SAP relevant data sets. Flexible real estate management was fairly new module at that time  and this was one of the largest Flex project ever for SAP. To meet the requirements , SAP provided us the code of next version even before general availability."

  desc: "TRW is a major auto parts supplier focused in active and passive safety systems  (acquired by ZF Friedrichshafen AG in 2015). TRW has 5 major manufacturing hubs in North America. Its head quarter is in Livonia Michigan. TRW was among the first to implement SAP in early 90s.  They had SAP version 3.1h running for their five different implementations. One for each plant. TRW contracted Satyam Computer Services Limited  ( Now part of Tech Mahindra) to upgrade all the implementations of SAP to the latest SAP stack. After initial analysis and looking at the new business requirements, we decided that SAP DIMP4.71 (Discreet Industries and Mill Product) was the best fit though there was no direct upgrade path from 3.1h to DIMP4.71. This meant that we need to double hop the upgrade from version 3.1h to ECC 4.6 and then from 4.6 to DIPM7.1. The bigger challenge, however, was no documentation from the old implementation. And huge number of customizations were added post go live. Many of them missing in Dev systems. Being the project manager, I had two choices - Leave the documentation and new business functionalities aside and just focus on technical upgrade or build the complete documentation ground up and implement changes to justify the cost of upgrade. We chose later and accomplished double hop for five parallel implementations along with full new documentation in 8 months."

  desc: " Manufacturing ERP systems  (MERPS) was the mega program undertaken by GSK to bring all their production to SAP. MERPS ran five wave each with an outlay of around 150 million pounds. The program was led by Accenture, SAP SE and CapeGemini. Towards the end of first wave they realized that they need a low cost SI for huge customization and integration with legacy system. Satyam Computers (now part of Tech Mahindra) was brought in as development partner in 2000. I was the first man on ground from Satyam in GSK. We started small with a team of 8 onsite senior consultant and went on to build one of the largest SAP engagement for Satyam. The peak team size reached to 45 consultants onsite in London and 150 developers in India. We set up first validated offshore center for GSK in India."

  i18n: 'Welspun'

  desc: " Welspun India Ltd. is a fully integrated textile manufacturer. Welspun textiles' two primary divisions are - Welspun Cotton yarn and Welspun Synthetics. Welspun contracted Satyam Computers in 1998 for SAP implementations for both the divisions. Welspun cotton yarn went is first in 1998. The second implementation was delayed for system stabilization. In 2000, they decided to implement SAP ERP for the synthetics division.  I was assigned Project Manager role to carry out this end to end implementation. Project team was co-located at their Vapi manufacturing facility. ERP implementation for process industry is quite a challenge. Though we had a template from previous implementation,  it was a totally new team on both Welspun as well as Satyam side. We managed to bring in many new features that  were retrofitted into cotton yarn business. We started on SAP 4.0b but moved on to migrate the landscape to SAP 4.6 as the new version was made available before realization phase. Project scope included all the  ERP modules FI, CO, SD, MM, PP-PI, COPA and Assets Accounting."
